# This script is meant to use with i3blocks. It parses the output of the "acpi"
# command (often provided by a package of the same name) to read the status of
# the battery, and eventually its remaining time (to full charge or discharge).
#
# The color will gradually change for a percentage below 85%, and the urgency
# (exit code 33) is set if there is less that 5% remaining.
